# Weather Sage Weather Dashboard

## Description

The Weather Sage weather dashboard was developed for travellers to enable them to plan trips by viewing weather outlooks for multiple cities. By integrating the OpenWeatherMap API, users could access current and future weather conditions. The dashboard featured form inputs for city searches and displayed detailed information, including city name, date, weather icons, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Additionally, a 5-day forecast for each city is available and accessible by clicking on the city in the search history.
